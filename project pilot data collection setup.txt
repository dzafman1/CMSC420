android app to gather accelerometer and audio data
two enabled devices mounted on each hand
might want a camera to know if user missed a step in narration - talk to mayank about this need
all test run actions are scripted - narration will be different across diff users

Devices: 
Android smartphone - Physics Toolbox Sensor Suite for accelerometer data
Android smartphone - Easy Voice Recorder for audio data

Both devices mounted on user's right and left forearm using phone armband
**Might want to have another person come and start both phones simultaneously for data recording to reduce lag 

*User should narrate steps naturally as they run through the script*
